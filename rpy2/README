Python interface to the R language.

rpy2 is running an embedded R, providing access to it 
from Python using R's own C-API through either:

1) a high-level interface making R functions an objects 
just like Python functions and providing a seamless 
conversion to numpy and pandas data structures

2) a low-level interface closer to the C-API

It is also providing features for when working with 
jupyter notebooks or ipython.

NOTE:
R libraries need to be shareable, thus:
build R on SBo with 
R-SHLIB=yes and 
BLAS_SHLIB=yes
