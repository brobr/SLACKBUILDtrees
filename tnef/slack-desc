# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

tnef: tnef (ms-tnef handler)
tnef:
tnef: TNEF is a program for unpacking MIME attachments of type 
tnef: "application/ms-tnef". This is a Microsoft only attachment. Due to the 
tnef: proliferation of Microsoft Outlook and Exchange mail servers, more and 
tnef: more mail is encapsulated into this format.
tnef: The TNEF program allows one to unpack the attachments which were 
tnef: encapsulated into the TNEF attachment. Thus alleviating the need to use 
tnef: Microsoft Outlook to view the attachment. Caveat: TNEF does not handle 
tnef: well attachments with non-Unicode filenames or data.
