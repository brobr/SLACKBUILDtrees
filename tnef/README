TNEF is a program for unpacking MIME attachments of type 
"application/ms-tnef". This is a Microsoft only attachment.

Due to the proliferation of Microsoft Outlook and Exchange mail 
servers, more and more mail is encapsulated into this format.

The TNEF program allows one to unpack the attachments which were 
encapsulated into the TNEF attachment. Thus alleviating the need to use Microsoft Outlook to view the attachment. Caveat: TNEF does not handle well attachments with non-Unicode filenames or data.

TNEF is mainly tested and used on GNU/Linux and CYGWIN systems. It 
'should' work on other UNIX and UNIX-like systems.
