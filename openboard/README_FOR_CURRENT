This build script is directly taken from willysr's repository at
 https://github.com/willysr/SlackHacks/tree/master/SlackBuilds/openboard

and adapted for current Qt5 and its quazip package by editing the
1) the SlackBuild (see annotations in the script) and
2) the quazip.patch from archlinux to a current-usable version (quazip.patch2).

These changes have been suggested to willysr.

3) a patch to remove the call for a wrong mime type that causes crashes when
attempting to load a flash movie (.swf, which no longer works on SLackware)
