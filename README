The slackware build scripts in this repository were created for personal use.
These scripts have not been deposited on Slackbuilfs.org because, say in the
case of leo, this package is already present/maintained.

NOTE the scripts presented here are maintained to build software that runs
on my laptop with Slackware64-current. If you want to use a script on your machine 
which has different architecture or version, use it at your own risk.

Any constructive feedback will be welcome.
