The slackware build scripts in this repository have been created for 
personal use and have not been deposited at Slackbuilds.org because:
1) Some scripts are an adaptation of existing scripts on Slackbuilfs.org
   (like leo, digimend-drivers-dkms)
2) Some scripts are only able to run on current and not on 14.2 (like 
   pikepdf and leo) due to a discrepancy in standard libraries (qpdf, 
   PyQT5). 
   Submission of pdfarranger depends on release of Slackware-15, and 
   will eventually replace python2-based pdfshuffler.

All depencies not provided here are available at SlackBuilds.org


NOTE the scripts presented here are maintained to build software that runs
on my laptop with Slackware64-current. If you want to use a script on your 
machine which has different architecture or version, use it at your own 
risk.

Any constructive feedback will be welcome.
