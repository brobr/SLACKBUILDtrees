Pikepdf is a Python library for reading and writing PDF files.
It is based on QPDF, a powerful PDF manipulation and repair
library. This library is similar to PyPDF2 and pdfrw - it provides 
low level access to PDF features and allows editing and content 
transformation of existing PDFs. Some knowledge of the PDF 
specification may be helpful. It does not have the capability to 
render a PDF to image.
