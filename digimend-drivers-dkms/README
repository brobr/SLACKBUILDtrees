This is a collection of graphics tablet drivers for the Linux kernel, produced
and maintained by the DIGImend project. We maintain this package to provide
newer drivers for older kernel versions which don't have them, and to allow
users to test new drivers before we contribute them to the mainline kernel.

On SLackbuilds.org a digimend-kernel-drivers package is available that requires
rebuilding (and installation of the drivers) after each kernel-upgrade.

This package uses dkms (see e.g. https://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.2/development/dkms/)
for installation. 

Dkms installs/uninstalls registered kernel drivers automatically after upgrading the kernel
(handy when on current) (see digimend/README)



In case of removing/upgrading the package, best to run (as root):

'dkms remove digimend/9' 

(or when the driver has to be removed from other
kernels than the running one): 

'dkms remove --all digimend/9'

before running 'removepkg'. (see man dkms)

When the dkms-remove step is omitted, and the driver-package is removed with
'removepkg', the dounist.sh aims to remove the bits installed by dkms. 

This script is still highly experimental.
Please if you have suggestions to improve it please let me know.
