This folder contains my slackbuilds to get a working installation of
leo on Slackware64 current. All packages will be built for python3.

These packages are used (and thus tested) on slackware64-current,
mainly as an outliner and organizer of notes; so most aspects of the
program are not used and if you find a bug in that respect please let
me know or check https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/issues.

There is no guarantuee this will work on Slackware-14.2 or older
versions.

See the leo-egginfo-requires.txt (copied from
leo.egg-info/requires.txt) 
for the version of PyQT5 needed, which used to be a bottle-neck.
(The leo-people are everything but conservative with their development
of leo)

This package came together thanks to Matt Wilkie
(https://github.com/maphew) and 
Edward Ream (https://github.com/edreamleo) who helped to resolve:
